Service		org.ofono
Interface	org.ofono.quectel.Hardware
Object path	/{device0,device1,...}

Methods		array{string,variant} GetProperties

			Returns hardware properties for the modem object. See
			the properties section for available properties.

Signals		PowerDown(string reason)

			This signal is emitted on gracefull shutdowns initiated
			by the modem.

			Possible reasons:
				"voltagelow"	The supply voltage is too low
				"normal"	The PWRKEY pin was asserted
				"voltagehigh"	The supply voltage is too high

		PowerWarning(string reason)

			This signal is emitted when the modem detects its supply
			voltage is close to its supported limits.

			Possible reasons:
				"voltagelow"	The supply voltage is low
				"voltagehigh"	The supply voltage is high

Properties	int32 Voltage [readonly]

			Integer with the modem supply voltage in mV.

		int32 ChargeStatus [readonly,optional]

			Integer with one of either:

			0: Modem is not charging
			1: Modem is charging
			2: Charging is finished

			This property is available on UC15

		int32 ChargeLevel [readonly,optional]

			Integer representing the battery charge level in
			percent (from 0 to 100).

			This property is available on UC15
